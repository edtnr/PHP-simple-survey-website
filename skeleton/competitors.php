// Things to notice:
// You need to add your Analysis and Design element of the coursework to this script
// There are lots of web-based survey tools out there already.
// Itâ€™s a great idea to create trial accounts so that you can research these systems. 
// This will help you to shape your own designs and functionality. 
// Your analysis of competitor sites should follow an approach that you can decide for yourself. 
// Examining each site and evaluating it against a common set of criteria will make it easier for you to draw comparisons between them. 
// You should use client-side code (i.e., HTML5/JavaScript/jQuery) to help you organise and present your information and analysis 
// For example, using tables, bullet point lists, images, hyperlinking to relevant materials, etc.

// execute the header script:
require_once "header.php";
